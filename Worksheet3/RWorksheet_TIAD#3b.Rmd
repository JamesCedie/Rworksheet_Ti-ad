#The graph highlights how peopleâ€™s feelings in tweets changed over several days,
#with shifts in positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. Negative tweets 
#peaked on July 15, likely in response to bad news, while there was an increase 
#in positive tweets on July 17, indicating a better mood. By July 20, neutral 
#tweets became the most common, suggesting more balanced or informational 
#posts during that time.
